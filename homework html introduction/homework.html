    <p><div style="font-size:48px; color:#F7F7F7   ">Hi, I'm Alex and a musician, and because I love music, I created this blog about music,
                                                     so welcome! For me music is passion and I think it can be deeper than any word. 
                                                     I played in a lot of concerts and every time I was glad I was able to convey an emotion, 
                                                     because that's music passion and emotion.
